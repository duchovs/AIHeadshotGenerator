## Key Landing Page Components

### 1. Hero Section with Interactive Demo
If hero section featured an interactive "try before you buy" element, users could:
- See a grid of 4-6 "before and after" headshot examples
- Click on any example to see different styles applied to the same person
- Include a simple call-to-action like "Click to see different styles" to encourage interaction

### 2. How It Works Section
A clear, visually engaging process breakdown with icons or animations:
1. Upload your photo
2. AI analyzes your features
3. Select your preferred style
4. Generate professional headshots
5. Download in high resolution

### 3. Interactive Style Gallery
Rather than just static examples:
- Display a carousel of "before" photos
- Let visitors click on style buttons (Professional, Creative, Executive, Casual)
- Show the transformation happen on screen
- The carousel should use "import { Slide } from 'react-slideshow-image';"

### 4. Pricing Section with Competitor Comparison
Since your pricing is competitive:
- Clean, transparent pricing tiers
- Feature comparison table with your top 2-3 competitors
- Highlight unique advantages (lower cost, faster generation, more style options)

### 5. Social Proof & Results
- Before/after transformations from actual customers
- Testimonials focused on ease of use and quality of results
- Usage statistics if available ("X headshots generated this month")

### 6. Call-to-Action Elements
- Free trial offer or sample generation (limited to 1-2 styles)
- Email capture for those not ready to commit
- "Generate your headshot now" primary button

## Interactive Elements to Consider

1. **Style Preview Tool**: Let visitors upload their own photo directly on the landing page to see a watermarked preview of one style (as a teaser)

2. **Animated Transformations**: Show the AI process with a subtle animation when users interact with examples

3. **Style Quiz**: "What headshot style best fits your industry?" - a quick 2-3 question quiz that recommends styles and shows examples

4. **Live Style Count**: "Join X users who've created professional headshots this week"
